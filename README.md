# 4-code-quiz
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is assignment 4 for the program. In this assignment I created a coding themed quiz application. The application consists of creating a timed quiz with multiple-choice questinos. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

It contains notable features such as:
- A timer
- dynamically rendered questions that swap once the user inputs an answer
- A time deduction penalty upon choosing an incorrect answer
- game resolution based once the time expires or all questions are answered
- A locally saved scorescreen with recorded user initials input
